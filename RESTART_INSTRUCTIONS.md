# RESTART INSTRUCTIONS - IMMEDIATE TASKS

## STATUS WHEN SESSION ENDED
- ✅ Local FastAPI server confirmed working (all endpoints 200 OK)
- ✅ Architectural consolidation completed
- ✅ All fixes consolidated in this accessible workspace
- ✅ Handoff documentation updated with CODEX sandbox limitations
- ⚠️ Deployment still needed from this location

## CRITICAL: CODEX SANDBOX LIMITATIONS
- CODEX cannot access `/Users/damianseguin/projects/mosaic-platform/`
- **MUST work from this location**: `/Users/damianseguin/Downloads/WIMD-Railway-Deploy-Project/`
- All fixed code already exists here (complete FastAPI, netlify.toml, requirements.txt)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS FOR CODEX
1. **Deploy Backend to Railway**
   - Push complete FastAPI code (449 lines) from `./api/index.py`
   - Includes fixed `requirements.txt` with `python-multipart`
   - Railway service: `what-is-my-delta-site`

2. **Deploy Frontend to Netlify**
   - Push frontend with complete `netlify.toml` proxy rules
   - Service: `resonant-crostata-90b706`
   - Domain: `https://whatismydelta.com`

3. **Test End-to-End**
   - Verify `https://whatismydelta.com/health` returns `{"ok": true}`
   - Test all API endpoints through domain

## KEY FILES READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
- `./api/index.py` - Complete 449-line FastAPI implementation
- `./requirements.txt` - Fixed with python-multipart dependency
- `./netlify.toml` - Complete proxy rules for all 15 API endpoints
- `./.env` - Environment variables (rotated API keys)

## BACKGROUND CONTEXT
- Missing dependency `python-multipart` was root cause of Railway failures
- Local development approach solved issue in 15 minutes vs 3+ hours of infrastructure debugging
- All architectural consolidation work completed but deployment from accessible location still needed

## DOCUMENTATION UPDATED
- `CODEX_HANDOVER_README.md` - Complete handoff with sandbox limitations documented
- `TROUBLESHOOTING_REPORT.md` - Full troubleshooting history
- `OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md` - Operational procedures

**PRIORITY**: Deploy from this workspace immediately - all fixes are ready.
