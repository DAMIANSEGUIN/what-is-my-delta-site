Summary:
- Chat is working (CORS fixed) but prompts return null
- Files keep getting lost due to directory confusion
- AI collaboration has broken down - not following protocols
- User considering moving to Netlify Agent Runners if this isn't fixed

Your tasks (detailed in handoff doc):
1. Fix prompts CSV loading issue (systematic analysis)
2. Create PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md (prevent file loss)
3. Define protocol enforcement (prevent chaos)

Present your analysis and plan for user approval before implementing anything.
