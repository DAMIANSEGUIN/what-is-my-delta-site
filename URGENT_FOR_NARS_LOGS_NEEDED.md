# URGENT: PostgreSQL Connection Failure - Logs Required

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** BLOCKED - Need Railway deployment logs to diagnose
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## Problem

PostgreSQL migration code is deployed but **silently failing back to SQLite**. We cannot diagnose the root cause without seeing the actual error message from the deployment logs.

**Evidence:**
- Health check shows: `"database":true` (SQLite fallback working)
- Users getting "Invalid credentials" (database still wiping on deploys)
- DATABASE_URL correctly set to `postgresql://...@postgres.railway.internal:5432/...`
- No visibility into WHY PostgreSQL connection is failing

---

## What NARs Must Do

### Get Railway Deployment Logs

1. **Railway Dashboard** → `what-is-my-delta-site` service
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click on the **most recent deployment** (should be from last few minutes)
4. Look for **startup logs** - specifically lines containing:
   - `[STORAGE]`
   - `PostgreSQL`
   - `psycopg2`
   - `connection failed`

5. **Copy the EXACT error message** from this line:
   ```
   [STORAGE] ❌ PostgreSQL connection failed: <ERROR MESSAGE HERE>
   ```

---

## Why We Need This

The code has a **silent fallback** that masks PostgreSQL failures:

```python
try:
    connection_pool = pool.SimpleConnectionPool(1, 20, DATABASE_URL)
    print("[STORAGE] ✅ PostgreSQL connection pool created successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[STORAGE] ❌ PostgreSQL connection failed: {e}")
    print("[STORAGE] Falling back to SQLite")
```

**Without the actual exception message (`{e}`), we cannot diagnose:**
- Wrong DATABASE_URL format?
- Network connectivity blocked?
- PostgreSQL credentials invalid?
- PostgreSQL service not accepting connections?
- SSL/TLS configuration issue?
- Firewall/security group blocking?

---

## Expected Log Output

### If PostgreSQL Working (Success):
```
Starting up...
[STORAGE] Attempting PostgreSQL connection...
[STORAGE] ✅ PostgreSQL connection pool created successfully
Running feature flag sync migration...
```

### If PostgreSQL Failing (Current State):
```
Starting up...
[STORAGE] Attempting PostgreSQL connection...
[STORAGE] ❌ PostgreSQL connection failed: <ACTUAL ERROR MESSAGE>
[STORAGE] Falling back to SQLite
Running feature flag sync migration...
✅ Backup created: data/migration_backups/...  ← SQLite path
```

---

## What NARs Should Report Back

**Please provide:**

1. **Exact error message** from `[STORAGE] ❌ PostgreSQL connection failed:` line
2. **Full startup logs** (first 100 lines of deployment)
3. **PostgreSQL service status** in Railway dashboard:
   - Is it showing "Active" or "Running"?
   - Any errors in PostgreSQL service logs?
4. **Network configuration:**
   - Are both services in the same Railway project?
   - Is private networking enabled between services?

## Possible Root Causes (Based on Error Message)

### Error: "could not connect to server"
- **Cause:** Network routing issue, PostgreSQL not accessible
- **Fix:** Check Railway private networking configuration

### Error: "password authentication failed"
- **Cause:** DATABASE_URL credentials don't match PostgreSQL service
- **Fix:** Regenerate DATABASE_URL from PostgreSQL service

### Error: "SSL required"
- **Cause:** PostgreSQL requires SSL, connection string missing `?sslmode=require`
- **Fix:** Append `?sslmode=require` to DATABASE_URL

### Error: "no pg_hba.conf entry"
- **Cause:** PostgreSQL not configured to accept connections from app
- **Fix:** Check PostgreSQL access controls in Railway

### Error: "database does not exist"
- **Cause:** DATABASE_URL points to wrong database name
- **Fix:** Verify database name in PostgreSQL service matches URL

## System Architecture Issue

**The silent fallback was a design mistake.**

**Why it exists:**
- Allows local development without PostgreSQL (uses SQLite)
- Prevents total application crash if database unavailable

**Why it's problematic in production:**
- Masks configuration errors
- App appears healthy while using wrong database
- No clear signal that PostgreSQL isn't working

**Should have done:**
- Fail loudly in production if DATABASE_URL set but connection fails
- Add health check endpoint that verifies PostgreSQL specifically
- Log connection errors to Railway dashboard prominently

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **NARs:** Get error message from logs (5 minutes)
2. **Diagnose:** Identify root cause from error message
3. **Fix:** Apply targeted solution based on actual error
4. **Verify:** Confirm PostgreSQL connection successful in logs
5. **Test:** Verify user persistence across deployments

**No more guessing. No more "try this" fixes. Get the error message first.**

**Status:** Awaiting Railway deployment logs from NARs

**Timeline:** Cannot proceed until actual error message obtained
