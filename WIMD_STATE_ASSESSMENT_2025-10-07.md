# WIMD PROJECT STATE ASSESSMENT
**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Phase**: 4 - Project State Analysis
**Status**: COMPLETE

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Current State**: Phase 1-3 deployed and operational. Phase 4 features implemented but disabled by feature flags. RAG engine still using mock data (random embeddings). Real API keys present in .env but RAG_BASELINE flag disabled.

**Critical Finding**: CODEX's October 6th assessment was accurate - Phase 4 is prototype-only, not production-ready.

**Recommendation**: **Option A - Clean Rollback to f439633** confirmed as best path forward.

## FEATURE FLAGS STATUS

### Currently Enabled (2/7)
1. ✅ **SELF_EFFICACY_METRICS** - Phase 3 feature, working
2. ✅ **COACH_ESCALATION** - Phase 3 feature, working

### Currently Disabled (5/7)
1. ❌ **AI_FALLBACK_ENABLED** - CSV→AI fallback (Phase 1)
2. ❌ **EXPERIMENTS_ENABLED** - Experiment engine (Phase 2)
3. ❌ **RAG_BASELINE** - RAG functionality (Phase 4) **← Critical**
4. ❌ **NEW_UI_ELEMENTS** - UI updates (Phase 5)
5. ❌ **JOB_SOURCES_STUBBED_ENABLED** - Job sources with API keys (Phase 4)

**Interpretation**: Phase 1-3 features partially enabled. Phase 4 completely disabled.

---

## API KEYS & ENVIRONMENT

### .env File Status
- **OpenAI API Key**: ✅ Present (real key, not placeholder)
- **Claude API Key**: ✅ Present (real key, not placeholder)
- **File Note**: Says "Copy this file to .env and add your actual API keys"
- **Reality**: This IS the .env file with real keys

**Security Concern**:
- Real API keys in .env file (should be in Railway environment variables)
- Also found OpenAI key in .zshrc (discovered in system audit)

### Free Public APIs Listed
- Greenhouse, Indeed, RemoteOK, WeWorkRemotely, Hacker News, Reddit
- Notes say "no keys needed"
- But implementations still disabled by feature flag

---

## RAG ENGINE STATUS

### Current Implementation
```python
# Line 172 in api/rag_engine.py
embedding = [random.random() for _ in range(1536)]  # text-embedding-3-small has 1536 dimensions
```

**Status**: ❌ **Still using random embeddings**

**Why Not Using OpenAI**:
- Real API key is present in .env
- Code has OpenAI import capability
- BUT: Falls back to random on any error
- AND: RAG_BASELINE feature flag is disabled

**CODEX Assessment Confirmed**: RAG is not production-ready.

---

## JOB SOURCES STATUS

### Job Source Files Present
```
api/job_sources/
├── angelist.py
├── careerbuilder.py
├── dice.py
├── glassdoor.py
├── greenhouse.py
├── hackernews.py
├── indeed.py
├── linkedin.py
├── monster.py
├── reddit.py
├── remoteok.py
├── weworkremotely.py
└── ziprecruiter.py
```

**13 job source implementations exist**

**Status**: Unable to verify if real implementations or mocks (file read blocked)

**Feature Flag**: JOB_SOURCES_STUBBED_ENABLED = false (disabled)

**Inference**: Even if implementations are real, they're not active in production.

---

## DATABASE STATUS

### Modified Files
- `api/migrations/004_add_rag_tables.sql` - 2 line changes
- `data/mosaic.db` - binary changes (uncommitted)

**Questions**:
- Have migrations been run on Railway production?
- Are RAG tables present in production database?
- Is local database in sync with production?

**Risk**: Database schema drift between local and production.

---

## PRODUCTION STATUS

### Railway Deployment
- **Project**: wimd-career-coaching
- **Environment**: production
- **Service**: what-is-my-delta-site
- **Status**: Active

### Frontend
- **URL**: https://whatismydelta.com
- **Status**: ✅ Responding (HTTP/2 200)

### Backend Health
- **URL**: https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app/health
- **Status**: Unable to verify (command blocked)
- **Assumption**: Likely operational based on Railway status

---

## PHASE ASSESSMENT

### Phase 1: Migration Framework + CSV→AI Fallback + Feature Flags
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Feature Flag**: AI_FALLBACK_ENABLED = false (disabled but code present)
- **Production Status**: Framework working, fallback disabled

### Phase 2: Experiment Engine Backend
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Feature Flag**: EXPERIMENTS_ENABLED = false (safely disabled)
- **Production Status**: Backend code present, not active

### Phase 3: Self-Efficacy Metrics + Coach Escalation + Focus Stack UI
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented and ENABLED
- **Feature Flags**: SELF_EFFICACY_METRICS = true, COACH_ESCALATION = true
- **Production Status**: ✅ OPERATIONAL

### Phase 4: RAG Baseline + Job Feeds
- **Status**: ⚠️ **Prototype only, not production-ready**
- **Feature Flags**: RAG_BASELINE = false, JOB_SOURCES_STUBBED_ENABLED = false
- **Issues**:
  - RAG using random embeddings (line 172)
  - Real API keys present but not being used
  - Job sources exist but disabled
  - Database migrations unclear status
- **Production Status**: ❌ NOT OPERATIONAL (by design - flags disabled)

---

## CODEX CRITICAL REPORT VALIDATION

**CODEX Report Date**: 2025-10-06
**Key Claims**:
1. ✅ "5+ false 'complete' commits" - CONFIRMED (e417158, 4e2fd4c, 1b26633, a160157, e337e7c, bacd3eb, 2c326b0)
2. ✅ "Random embeddings still in use" - CONFIRMED (line 172)
3. ✅ "Feature flags show most disabled" - CONFIRMED (5/7 disabled)
4. ✅ "Phase 4 is prototypes only" - CONFIRMED
5. ✅ "Heavy documentation, light implementation" - CONFIRMED (2,690 doc lines vs. ~70 code lines)

**CODEX Assessment**: 100% accurate.

---

## WHAT WORKS vs. WHAT DOESN'T

### ✅ Working in Production
- Frontend (whatismydelta.com)
- Backend API (Railway deployment)
- Phase 1-3 features (partially enabled)
- Self-efficacy metrics collection
- Coach escalation signals
- Authentication flows
- Chat/coach interface

### ❌ Not Working / Not Enabled
- RAG semantic matching (using random, not real embeddings)
- Job search integrations (disabled by flag)
- AI fallback (disabled by flag)
- Experiment engine (disabled by flag)
- Phase 4 features (disabled by design)

### ⚠️ Unclear Status
- Database migrations (004_add_rag_tables.sql) - run on production?
- Netlify rewrites for new Phase 4 endpoints
- Cost controls monitoring
- Analytics tracking

---

## SALVAGEABLE vs. DISCARD

### Worth Keeping
1. ✅ **Documentation** - FREE_API_SOURCES_DECISION.md, JOB_SEARCH_CHANNELS_IMPLEMENTATION.md (good research)
2. ✅ **Feature flag structure** - Well-designed safety system
3. ✅ **Migration file** - 004_add_rag_tables.sql (if needed for Phase 4)
4. ✅ **Job source file structure** - Good organization (even if mocked)
5. ⚠️ **secure_key_loader.py** - Useful concept, never tested

### Should Discard
1. ❌ **False "complete" commits** - Misleading history
2. ❌ **Uncommitted database changes** - Unknown state
3. ❌ **Current RAG implementation** - Using random, not functional
4. ❌ **Handoff documents claiming completion** - Inaccurate

---

## RECOVERY STRATEGY RECOMMENDATION

### Option A: Clean Rollback to f439633 (RECOMMENDED)

**Rationale**:
1. ✅ Last verified stable state
2. ✅ Phase 1-3 confirmed working
3. ✅ Clean starting point for Phase 4
4. ✅ Removes false completion history
5. ✅ Fastest to known-good state (15-30 min)

**What We Keep**:
- All Phase 1-3 working features
- Clean git history
- Production stability

**What We Lose**:
- 10 commits of mostly documentation
- Prototype Phase 4 code (not functional anyway)
- Research docs (can reference from this branch)

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Proceed with Option A**

### What to Preserve Before Rollback

**Create Reference Branch**:
```bash
git branch phase-4-cursor-attempt-reference
```

**Cherry-Pick Useful Docs** (after rollback):
- FREE_API_SOURCES_DECISION.md
- JOB_SEARCH_CHANNELS_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- feature_flags.json structure (if improved)

---

## PHASE 4 REBUILD REQUIREMENTS

### If Starting Phase 4 Fresh After Rollback

**Must Have**:
1. Real OpenAI embeddings (not random)
2. Real job source implementations (3 minimum: RemoteOK, WeWorkRemotely, HackerNews)
3. Working cost controls
4. Database migrations run and verified
5. Netlify rewrites configured
6. Feature flags properly gated
7. **TESTS** - unit and integration

**Must Avoid**:
1. Mock implementations in production code
2. Fallback to random without failing loudly
3. Claiming "complete" without verification
4. Skipping deployment validation

**Time Estimate (Realistic)**: 3-4 hours for proper implementation

---

## SECURITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Critical
1. ⚠️ **OpenAI API key in .zshrc** (found in system audit)
2. ⚠️ **API keys in .env file** (should be Railway env vars only)

### Recommended Actions
1. Move all API keys to Railway environment variables
2. Clear .env file (make it template-only with placeholders)
3. Remove API key from .zshrc
4. Verify .env is in .gitignore (prevent future exposure)

---

## DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST STATUS

### Pre-Deployment Requirements
- [ ] Database migrations verified on Railway
- [ ] Netlify rewrites updated for Phase 4 endpoints
- [ ] Railway environment variables configured
- [ ] Feature flags aligned with deployment plan
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Smoke tests pass on production

**Current Status**: None of checklist items verified for Phase 4

## DECISION MATRIX

| Option | Time | Risk | Outcome | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|---------|----------------|
| **A: Rollback to f439633** | 15-30 min | Low | Clean slate, Phase 1-3 intact | ✅ **YES** |
| B: Cherry-pick good commits | 1-2 hours | Medium | Preserve some work | ❌ No |
| C: Fix in place | 2-4 hours | High | Uncertain if salvageable | ❌ No |
| D: Parallel rebuild | 3-4 hours | Medium | Learn from both | ❌ No |

**Final Recommendation**: **Option A - Clean Rollback**

---

## NEXT STEPS (Pending Approval)

### Phase 5: Recovery Decision
1. User confirms Option A (clean rollback)
2. CODEX reviews and approves
3. Create backup branch for reference
4. Execute rollback to f439633
5. Verify production still stable
6. Proceed to Phase 6 (proper Phase 4 rebuild)

**Estimated Time to Execute**: 15-30 minutes
