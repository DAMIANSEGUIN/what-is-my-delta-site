# START HERE - Session Initialization Protocol

üö® **STOP**: Before doing ANYTHING, complete this checklist.

---

## Session Startup Checklist (Required - Do Not Skip)

**Every new session MUST complete these steps in order:**

- [ ] **1. Read this entire document**
- [ ] **2. Identify your role** from the list below
- [ ] **3. Read CODEX_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Understand roles, handoff protocols, boundaries
- [ ] **4. Read PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** - Know where all files live
- [ ] **5. Check latest status** - Find most recent DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_*.md or NARS_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_*.md
- [ ] **6. Read architecture docs** - AI_ROUTING_PLAN.md (how coaching works), OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md (how to deploy)

**If you skip these steps, you WILL make mistakes that waste time.**

---

## Your Role (Required - Identify Before Proceeding)

### **Claude Code** - Infrastructure Debugger
- **Access**: Railway logs, deployment analysis, infrastructure troubleshooting
- **Tasks**: Railway deployment failures, health check issues, environment config
- **Read**: OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md, DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_*.md
- **Do NOT**: Make code changes without CODEX planning

### **CODEX** - Systematic Planning Engineer
- **Access**: Code analysis, file reading, systematic planning
- **Tasks**: Implementation planning, architecture review, gap analysis
- **Read**: All architecture docs, source documents
- **Do NOT**: Implement without creating plan and getting human approval

### **Claude in Cursor** - Local Implementation Engineer
- **Access**: Full local environment, git, file system, terminal
- **Tasks**: Code implementation, testing, git operations, Railway deployment execution
- **Read**: Implementation plans from CODEX
- **Do NOT**: Implement without CODEX plan or make architectural decisions alone

## If User Reports a Problem

**üö® STOP. Do NOT start debugging immediately.**

Follow this decision tree:

### Step 1: Is This a Missing Feature or a Bug?

1. **Read MOSAIC_USER_EXPERIENCE_SOURCE_DOC.md** - Check "What's Missing" section
2. **If issue is listed under "What's Missing"**:
   - This is a **missing feature**, not a bug
   - It needs **implementation**, not debugging
   - Source documents exist, code does not
   - Hand off to CODEX for implementation planning

3. **If issue is NOT in "What's Missing"**:
   - This is likely a **bug** in existing code
   - Follow your role's debugging protocol
   - Check DEPLOYMENT_STATUS for recent changes

### Step 2: Find the Source Documents

- **Problem-solving flow**: `/Users/damianseguin/projects/mosaic-platform/frontend/assets/PS101_Intro_and_Prompts.docx`
- **Foundation doc**: `/Users/damianseguin/Mosaic/foundation/Mosaic_Foundation_v1.0.md`
- **Prompt library**: `data/prompts_clean.csv`, `data/prompts_registry.json`
- **Architecture**: See PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md for complete list

### Step 3: Check Implementation Status

- **Implemented**: Check `api/` directory for endpoints
- **Frontend exists**: Check `mosaic_ui/index.html` for UI elements
- **Backend endpoints**: See AI_ROUTING_PLAN.md for what should exist

---

## Document Types (Critical - Know the Difference)

### **SOURCE Documents** (Contains Actual Content)
- **PS101_Intro_and_Prompts.docx** - The 10-step guided sequence
- **Mosaic_Foundation_v1.0.md** - Foundation principles
- **prompts_clean.csv** - 607 coaching prompts for tangent support
- **Purpose**: These ARE the requirements, content, and design

### **ANALYSIS Documents** (Gap Analysis)
- **MOSAIC_USER_EXPERIENCE_SOURCE_DOC.md** - What's built vs. what's planned
- **FORENSIC_ANALYSIS_*.md** - Investigation of issues
- **Purpose**: When these say "Missing", it means "not implemented in product", NOT "document doesn't exist"
- **When to read**: Before implementing features to understand gaps

### **OPERATIONS Documents** (How to Deploy/Maintain)
- **OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md** - Deployment procedures, troubleshooting
- **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** - File locations, git remotes, deployment targets
- **Purpose**: How to operate the system

### **ARCHITECTURE Documents** (How System Works)
- **AI_ROUTING_PLAN.md** - CSV ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Fallback coaching flow
- **CODEX_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Role definitions, handoff protocols
- **Purpose**: How the system is designed to function

### **STATUS Documents** (Current State)
- **DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_*.md** - Latest deployment state
- **NARS_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_*.md** - Recent deployment results
- **Purpose**: What's currently live, what changed recently

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå **Mistake 1: "Deployment successful = job done"**
- Health checks passing ‚â† product matches design
- Always verify: Does user experience match MOSAIC_USER_EXPERIENCE_SOURCE_DOC.md vision?

### ‚ùå **Mistake 2: "Missing in docs = doesn't exist"**
- MOSAIC_USER_EXPERIENCE_SOURCE_DOC.md lists implementation gaps
- Source documents exist at paths in PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- Check both before assuming anything is missing

### ‚ùå **Mistake 3: "Fix symptoms without understanding system"**
- User reports error ‚Üí Read architecture first
- Is this a missing feature? Check gap analysis docs
- Is this a bug? Check recent deployment status

### ‚ùå **Mistake 4: "Skip role boundaries"**
- Claude Code should not plan implementations (that's CODEX)
- CODEX should not execute deployments (that's Claude in Cursor)
- Follow handoff protocols in CODEX_INSTRUCTIONS.md

## Quick Reference Card

### **I'm starting a new session**
‚Üí Read: This document (START_HERE.md)
‚Üí Then: CODEX_INSTRUCTIONS.md
‚Üí Then: PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md

### **User says feature doesn't work**
‚Üí Read: MOSAIC_USER_EXPERIENCE_SOURCE_DOC.md first
‚Üí Check: Is it in "What's Missing"? ‚Üí Needs implementation, not debugging
‚Üí If not missing: Follow debugging protocol for your role

### **I'm debugging a deployment issue**
‚Üí Read: OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md, latest DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_*.md
‚Üí Role: Claude Code
‚Üí Check: Railway logs, health checks, environment variables

### **I'm implementing a feature**
‚Üí Read: Source documents in `/projects/mosaic-platform/`
‚Üí Read: Architecture docs (AI_ROUTING_PLAN.md)
‚Üí Process: CODEX plans ‚Üí Human approves ‚Üí Claude in Cursor implements

### **I need to understand the architecture**
‚Üí Read: AI_ROUTING_PLAN.md (coaching flow)
‚Üí Read: MOSAIC_WAYFINDING_DIAGRAM.md (user journey)
‚Üí Read: PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md (where everything lives)

### **I don't know what to do**
‚Üí Read: This document again
‚Üí Read: CODEX_INSTRUCTIONS.md (role definitions)
‚Üí Ask: Human for clarification

## Success Criteria

**You have successfully initialized when:**

‚úÖ You know your role and its boundaries
‚úÖ You know where to find source documents
‚úÖ You understand the difference between "missing from implementation" and "document doesn't exist"
‚úÖ You know the handoff protocols
‚úÖ You've read the current deployment status
‚úÖ You understand the system architecture

**If you cannot check all boxes above, re-read the required documents.**

---

## Protocol Enforcement

**If an AI violates these protocols:**
1. Human will stop the session
2. AI must re-read this document
3. AI must explain what they should have done differently
4. Session resumes only after protocol understanding confirmed

**These protocols exist for efficiency and system resilience, not bureaucracy.**
