# WIMD Deployment Troubleshooting Report

**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Issue Resolution**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Total Time Invested**: ~3 hours
**Root Cause**: Missing `python-multipart` dependency

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Problem**: Railway deployment showed successful builds but served minimal "Hello World" app instead of complete 449-line FastAPI implementation.

**Root Cause**: Missing `python-multipart` dependency caused FastAPI application startup failure. Railway fell back to serving a basic app instead of showing the startup error.

**Solution**: Added `python-multipart` to requirements.txt. Railway now serves complete Mosaic Platform API.

**Key Learning**: Local development debugging revealed the issue in minutes, while infrastructure debugging consumed hours without success.

---

## üìã PROBLEM TIMELINE

### **Initial Symptoms**
- ‚úÖ Railway builds: Successful
- ‚úÖ Railway deployments: Successful
- ‚ùå API Response: `{"message":"Hello World"}` instead of expected Mosaic API
- ‚ùå API Endpoints: 404 errors for `/config`, `/health`, `/prompts/active`
- ‚ùå Domain routing: whatismydelta.com showed Netlify 404s

### **Failed Debugging Approaches (2+ hours)**
1. **Nuclear Cache Clearing**: Multiple cache-busting strategies, force deployments
2. **Repository Verification**: Confirmed correct git remote and complete code
3. **Environment Variables**: Verified all Railway variables correctly set
4. **Infrastructure Analysis**: Assumed Railway/Netlify routing issues
5. **Multi-platform Strategies**: Prepared Vercel/Render alternatives

### **Successful Approach (15 minutes)**
1. **Local Development Setup**: Ran FastAPI locally with production environment
2. **Immediate Error Discovery**: Found missing `python-multipart` dependency
3. **Simple Fix**: Added dependency to requirements.txt
4. **Deployment Success**: Railway immediately served complete API

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### **What Actually Happened**
1. Railway successfully built the application with existing dependencies
2. Railway attempted to start the FastAPI application
3. FastAPI failed during startup due to missing `python-multipart` (required for file upload endpoints)
4. Railway fell back to serving a minimal default application
5. No error logs were visible to indicate the startup failure

### **Why the Problem Persisted**
- **Hidden Error Messages**: Railway masked startup failures with fallback app
- **Successful Build != Successful Runtime**: Dependencies installed, but runtime requirements missing
- **Infrastructure Assumption**: Treated as deployment pipeline issue rather than application issue
- **No Local Verification**: Never tested the application locally before deployment

### **Technical Details**
```python
# FastAPI file upload endpoints require python-multipart
@app.post("/wimd/upload", response_model=UploadResponse)
async def wimd_upload(
    file: UploadFile = File(...),  # This requires python-multipart
    ...
```

**Error**: `RuntimeError: Form data requires "python-multipart" to be installed.`

## ‚úÖ VERIFIED SOLUTION

### **Local Development Setup (Working)**
```bash
# Environment Setup
export OPENAI_API_KEY="[rotated_key]"
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="[rotated_key]"
export PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN="https://whatismydelta.com"
export APP_SCHEMA_VERSION="v1"

# Install Complete Dependencies
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt

# Start Application
python3 -m uvicorn api.index:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Server starts successfully, all endpoints working

### **Updated requirements.txt**
```
fastapi
uvicorn
gunicorn
httpx
pydantic
pydantic-settings
python-multipart  # ‚Üê CRITICAL ADDITION
```

### **Railway Deployment (Working)**
After adding `python-multipart`:
- ‚úÖ Build: Successful
- ‚úÖ Startup: Successful
- ‚úÖ API Response: `{"message":"Mosaic Platform API - Complete Implementation",...}`
- ‚úÖ All Endpoints: Working (health, config, prompts, etc.)

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED

### **Development Process Improvements**
1. **Local-First Debugging**: Always test applications locally before investigating infrastructure
2. **Dependency Verification**: Ensure runtime requirements match development environment
3. **Error Visibility**: Production platforms may hide critical startup errors
4. **Systematic Approach**: Check simple causes before complex infrastructure solutions

### **Canonical Troubleshooting Protocol**
**When deployment succeeds but wrong application serves:**

1. **Local Environment Test**:
   ```bash
   # Use exact production environment variables
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
   export CLAUDE_API_KEY="..."
   # etc.

   # Test locally
   python3 -m uvicorn api.index:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **If Local Fails**: Fix dependency/code issues
3. **If Local Works**: Investigate platform-specific deployment issues
4. **Deploy Fix**: Update requirements.txt, redeploy, verify

### **Technical Insights**
- **FastAPI File Uploads**: Always require `python-multipart` dependency
- **Railway Fallback Behavior**: Serves basic app when main application fails to start
- **Requirements.txt Completeness**: Critical for runtime dependency resolution
- **Environment Parity**: Local and production must have identical dependencies

## üìû REFERENCE COMMANDS

### **Local Development Verification**
```bash
# Quick local test
cd /Users/damianseguin/Downloads/WIMD-Railway-Deploy-Project
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
python3 -m uvicorn api.index:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/config
curl http://localhost:8000/prompts/active
```

### **Production Verification**
```bash
# Railway API direct
curl https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app/health
curl https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app/config

# Domain routing (after Netlify proxy configured)
curl https://whatismydelta.com/health
curl https://whatismydelta.com/config
```

### **Dependency Check**
```bash
# Verify python-multipart installed
python3 -c "import multipart; print('python-multipart: OK')"

# Check requirements.txt
grep python-multipart requirements.txt
```

- [ ] Confirm database/data file accessibility

### **Monitoring Setup**
- [ ] Monitor Railway startup logs for FastAPI errors
- [ ] Set up health check alerts for API endpoints
- [ ] Verify environment variable loading on deployment
- [ ] Test API responses match local development

### **Documentation Updates**
- [x] Added local development setup to README.md
- [x] Updated OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md with dependency requirements
