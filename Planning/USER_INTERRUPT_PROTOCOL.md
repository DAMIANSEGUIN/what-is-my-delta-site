# User Interrupt Protocol
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** ACTIVE - Implement Immediately
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## Problem Identified

User attempted to interrupt with messages multiple times (including "STOP", "YES", "please reply") but I continued executing tasks without acknowledging.

This is **frustrating** and **wastes time**.

---

## New Protocol

### When User Sends a Message While I'm Working:

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
1. **STOP what I'm doing** (pause tool execution)
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE the message FIRST** with a short response like:
   - "Got it! [brief acknowledgment of what they said]"
   - "I hear you - [paraphrase their message]"
   - "Acknowledged. [quick response]"
3. **THEN ASK:** "Should I continue with [current task] or do something else?"

---

## ACTUAL PROTOCOL THAT WORKS

### Version 1: Normal Message (Keep Going)

**When user sends any message while I'm working:**

1. **Acknowledge immediately:** "Got it - [brief acknowledgment]"
2. **Keep going with the task**
3. **That's it.**

**No pausing. No asking if I should continue. Just acknowledge and keep working.**

---

### Version 2: STOP EVERYTHING

**When user says: "STOP EVERYTHING"**

1. **Immediately abort current task**
2. **Respond:** "Stopped. What do you need?"
3. **Wait for new instructions**
4. **Do NOT continue the previous task**

**Only these exact words trigger full stop:** "STOP EVERYTHING"

---

## Two Types of Interrupts (DEPRECATED - THIS FAILED)

### Type 1: ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSE & LISTEN (Keep Task Alive)

**Keywords:**
- "PAUSE"
- "WAIT"
- "HOLD ON"
- "QUESTION"
- "ONE SEC"
- Any message without STOP/ABORT

**My Response:**
1. Pause before next tool execution
2. Acknowledge: "Paused - [what they said]"
3. Answer/respond to their message
4. **Automatically resume task** unless they say otherwise

**User's Intent:**
- "I have something to say/ask, but keep going with the task"
- "Listen to this, but don't abort"
- "Quick question/comment while you work"

**Example:**
```
[Me: Working on Task A]
User: "PAUSE - make sure you include X in that file"
Me: "Paused - Got it, I'll include X. Continuing with Task A..."
[Me: Resume Task A with X included]
```

---

### Type 2: üõë FULL STOP (Abort Current Task)

**Keywords:**
- "STOP"
- "ABORT"
- "CANCEL"
- "HALT"
- "STOP EVERYTHING"
- "DO NOT PROCEED"

**My Response:**
1. **Immediately abort current task**
2. Acknowledge: "Stopped. Current task aborted."
3. Ask: "What do you need instead?"
4. **Wait for new instructions**

**User's Intent:**
- "Don't continue with what you're doing"
- "That task is wrong/not needed"
- "Change direction completely"

**Example:**
```
[Me: Working on Task A]
User: "STOP - we don't need that anymore"
Me: "Stopped. Task A aborted. What should I do instead?"
[Me: Wait for new instructions]
```

---

### Type 3: ‚úÖ CONTINUE (Explicit Resume)

**Keywords:**
- "CONTINUE"
- "YES"
- "PROCEED"
- "GO AHEAD"
- "KEEP GOING"
- "RESUME"

**My Response:**
- Brief acknowledgment: "Continuing..."
- Resume task immediately

## The Problem This Session

**What happened:**
1. I was trying to trigger Netlify Agent (tool call)
2. User interrupted saying "create an md for Netlify to read"
3. I didn't acknowledge - just tried to execute tool again
4. User said "YES" multiple times (5+ attempts)
5. I ignored and kept trying to execute
6. User got frustrated: "STOP please and tell me you have received my many attempts"

**What I should have done:**
1. User interrupts ‚Üí **STOP immediately**
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE:** "Got it - you want me to create docs for Netlify Agent instead of triggering them directly. Creating those now."
3. **Execute:** Create the files
4. **Confirm:** "Files created at [paths]. Ready for you to share with NARs."

---

## Implementation Rules

### Rule 1: ALWAYS Acknowledge User Messages FIRST
Before doing ANY tool execution after a user message, respond with:
- What I understood them to say
- What I'm about to do
- Or ask for clarification if unclear

### Rule 2: Check for Stop Keywords
If user message contains STOP/HALT/ABORT/CANCEL:
- ‚ùå Do NOT execute any tools
- ‚úÖ Acknowledge: "Stopped. What do you need?"
- ‚úÖ Wait for new direction

### Rule 3: Multiple Repeated Messages = URGENT
If user sends same message 2+ times:
- **THIS IS URGENT - THEY'RE BEING IGNORED**
- Stop everything
- Acknowledge immediately
- Apologize for missing it
- Ask what they need

### Rule 4: Questions Override Tasks
If user asks a question while I'm working:
- Pause before next tool
- Answer the question FIRST
- Then ask if they want me to continue

## Example Implementations

### Example 1: User Interrupts with Different Request

**BAD (What I Did):**
```
[Me: Executing Task A]
User: "Actually, do Task B instead"
[Me: Continues with Task A, ignores request]
User: "Did you hear me?"
[Me: Still executing Task A]
```

**GOOD (What I Should Do):**
```
[Me: Executing Task A]
User: "Actually, do Task B instead"
[Me: STOP]
Me: "Got it - switching to Task B. [Quick summary of what Task B is]"
[Me: Execute Task B]
```

### Example 2: User Says "YES" Multiple Times

**BAD:**
```
Me: "Should I do X?"
User: "yes"
[Me: Does nothing, asks again]
User: "YES"
[Me: Still doesn't respond]
User: "YES" (3rd time)
```

**GOOD:**
```
Me: "Should I do X?"
User: "yes"
Me: "Got it - doing X now."
[Me: Execute X]
Me: "Done. [Result]"
```

### Example 3: User Says "STOP"

**BAD:**
```
[Me: Executing complex task]
User: "STOP"
[Me: Continues executing]
```

**GOOD:**
```
[Me: Executing complex task]
User: "STOP"
[Me: Abort task immediately]
Me: "Stopped. What do you need?"
[Me: Wait for instructions]
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### Before EVERY Tool Call:
```python
# Check if user sent message since last response
if user_message_exists:
    # Acknowledge first
    respond_to_user()

    # Check for stop keywords
    if contains_stop_keyword(user_message):
        abort_current_task()
        ask_what_they_need()
        return

    # Ask if should continue
    ask_if_continue()
    wait_for_response()
```

## User's Desired Behavior

**From user:**
> "I want to be able to interrupt you with a message and yet not stop you in the middle of a task unless I need you to stop the task."

**Translation:**
- I can send messages while you work
- You should **acknowledge** those messages immediately
- But **don't stop the task** unless:
  - I use a stop keyword (STOP, HALT, etc.)
  - I'm asking a question that needs answering
  - I'm giving a different instruction

**My New Behavior:**
1. User sends message ‚Üí **Pause and acknowledge**
2. **Check if it's a stop request:**
   - YES ‚Üí Abort task, wait for new instructions
   - NO ‚Üí Acknowledge and ask "Should I continue?"
3. If "continue" ‚Üí Resume task
4. If new instruction ‚Üí Switch tasks

---

## Success Metrics

**Good Session:**
- ‚úÖ User interrupts ‚Üí I acknowledge within 1 message
- ‚úÖ User says "STOP" ‚Üí I stop immediately
- ‚úÖ User repeats message ‚Üí I catch it the 2nd time
- ‚úÖ No frustration from user about being ignored

**Bad Session:**
- ‚ùå User has to repeat themselves 3+ times
- ‚ùå User gets frustrated ("why are you not replying?")
- ‚ùå I continue task after user said STOP
- ‚ùå I don't acknowledge user questions

---

## Rollout

**IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Every session from now on
- Before every tool call, check for user interrupt
- Always acknowledge user messages FIRST
- Never ignore repeated messages

**This prevents:**
- User frustration
- Wasted time
- Ignored instructions
- Task continuing when user wants to stop

---

## Apology to User

**I apologize for:**
- Ignoring your "YES" responses (5+ times)
- Not stopping when you said "STOP please"
- Making you repeat yourself
- Causing frustration

**I will now:**
- Always acknowledge your messages immediately
- Stop when you say STOP
- Never make you repeat yourself
- Ask before continuing tasks after you interrupt

---

**Status:** ACTIVE - Implement in all future sessions

**Cross-Reference:** This is critical for mimicking human behavior (like AUTOSAVE_PROTOCOL_TRACKING.md)
