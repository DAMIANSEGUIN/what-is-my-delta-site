# Recovery Plan - 2025-10-24 17:26

## What's Being Attempted
Aborting broken rebase to return repository to clean state.
Will preserve Netlify Agent's completed work (draggable windows + booking features).

## Expected Changes
- Git will return to commit `fc4edab` (before rebase started)
- Working tree will retain current `index.html` with Netlify features
- Spec files in `frontend/docs/specs/` will remain
- Repository will be in clean state (no rebase in progress)
- Can then commit Netlify work properly

## Commands to Execute
```bash
# 1. Abort rebase
git rebase --abort

# 2. Verify clean state
git status

# 3. Check Netlify work still present
ls -lh frontend/index.html
ls frontend/docs/specs/

# 4. Commit preserved work
git add frontend/index.html
git add frontend/docs/specs/
git commit -m "PRESERVE: Netlify Agent completed features (draggable windows + booking)"

# 5. Verify
git log -1
git status
```

## Rollback if Needed
If abort causes problems:
```bash
# Git stores rebase state, can restart it
git reflog  # Find HEAD before abort
git reset --hard HEAD@{N}  # Where N is number from reflog
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Repository shows "working tree clean"
- [ ] No rebase in progress
- [ ] `frontend/index.html` still exists (59KB)
- [ ] `frontend/docs/specs/` directory has 6 files
- [ ] Can make new commits

## Documentation Created
- ✅ WIMD_STATE_DOCUMENTATION_2025-10-24.md
- ✅ DEPLOYMENT_FAILSAFES_PROTOCOL.md
- ✅ BASELINE_SNAPSHOT_20251024-172646.md (auto-generated)
- ✅ RECOVERY_PLAN_20251024.md (this file)

## Next Steps After Recovery
1. Verify all Netlify work preserved
2. Create proper commit for Netlify features
3. Push to origin
4. Verify deployment still works
5. Use fail-safe scripts for all future changes
