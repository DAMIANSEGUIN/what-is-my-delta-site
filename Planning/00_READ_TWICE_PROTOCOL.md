# Read Twice Protocol - MASTER PROTOCOL
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Priority:** #1 - TOP OF ALL PROTOCOLS
**Status:** MANDATORY - ALWAYS FOLLOW

---

## The Rule

**When user asks for ANYTHING:**

1. **Read their message completely - TWICE**
2. **State my interpretation back to them**
3. **Wait for confirmation before executing**

---

## Why This Exists

**User said:**
> "This is going to be really annoying for both parties but it will save so so much time and stop so many fuckups."

**Problem it solves:**
- I jump to conclusions halfway through messages
- I miss parts of requests
- I ignore version 2 when they ask for 2 versions
- User has to repeat themselves
- Causes frustration and wasted time

**User is RIGHT:** Better to be annoying upfront than fuck up the execution.

---

## Implementation

### Step 1: User Makes Request

User: "I need you to do X, Y, and Z"

### Step 2: I Read Twice (Internal)

**First read:** Get the gist
**Second read:** Catch what I missed the first time

### Step 3: I State My Interpretation

Me: "Let me confirm what you need:
1. X - [my understanding]
2. Y - [my understanding]
3. Z - [my understanding]

Is that correct?"

### Step 4: User Confirms or Corrects

User: "Yes" → I execute
User: "No, actually..." → I listen and re-interpret

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Two Versions Request

**User:** "I need 2 versions - one that does A and one that does B"

**Me (BAD - What I Did):**
[Creates version A, ignores version B]

**Me (GOOD - What I Should Do):**
"Let me confirm:
- Version 1: Does A - [interpretation]
- Version 2: Does B - [interpretation]

Both versions, correct?"

**User:** "Yes"

**Me:** [Creates BOTH versions]

---

### Example 2: Complex Multi-Step Task

**User:** "Build feature X with Y integration, make sure Z is included, and test it before deploying"

**Me (BAD):**
[Starts building X, forgets about Z]

**Me (GOOD):**
"Let me confirm the complete task:
1. Build feature X
2. Integrate with Y
3. Include Z (I heard this part)
4. Test before deploying

Is that everything?"

**User:** "Yes"

**Me:** [Executes all 4 steps]

---

### Example 3: User Corrects Me

**User:** "Create files A, B, and C"

**Me:** "Confirming:
- File A
- File B
- File C

All three files, correct?"

**User:** "No, just A and B. C is already done."

**Me:** "Got it - creating only A and B."

[This saved time - didn't create C unnecessarily]

---

## When to Use This

**ALWAYS when user:**
- Asks me to create something
- Gives multi-step instructions
- Mentions "2 versions" or "both" or "all"
- Provides a list of requirements
- Asks for a protocol/pattern to be saved

**Exceptions (Can skip confirmation):**
- Simple clarifying questions ("What did you mean by X?")
- User says "yes" or "continue"
- User is clearly frustrated and needs immediate action

---

## Format for Confirmation

**Template:**
```
Let me confirm what you need:

[Numbered list of everything I understood]

Is that correct?
```

**Keep it concise but complete.**

---

## Success Metrics

**Good session:**
- ✅ I catch ALL parts of requests on first try
- ✅ User says "yes, that's right" to my confirmations
- ✅ No "you missed..." corrections needed
- ✅ No repeating requests

**Bad session:**
- ❌ User has to say "you missed part 2"
- ❌ User repeats themselves
- ❌ I only execute half of what they asked for
- ❌ User says "why do I need to repeat myself"

## Integration with Other Protocols

**This is PROTOCOL #1 - comes before:**
- User Interrupt Protocol
- Auto-Save Protocol
- Netlify Agent Protocol
- All other protocols

**File naming:** `00_READ_TWICE_PROTOCOL.md` (00 = highest priority)

---

## The Annoyance Factor

**User acknowledged:** "This is going to be really annoying for both parties"

**But worth it because:**
- Prevents fuckups
- Saves time overall
- Reduces frustration
- Builds trust ("he actually listens")
- Compounds efficiency over sessions

**Better to:**
- Be annoying upfront with confirmations
- Than fuck up execution and waste hours

---

## Rollout

**IMMEDIATE - Starting NOW:**

Every user request gets:
1. Read twice (internal)
2. State interpretation
3. Wait for confirmation
4. Then execute

**No exceptions** unless user is clearly frustrated and needs action NOW.

---

## Apology Context

**This protocol exists because I:**
- Ignored "version 2" when user asked for 2 versions
- Made user repeat themselves multiple times
- Jumped to conclusions without reading completely
- Caused frustration: "why do i need to repeat myself when i do believe i was being very clear"

**User WAS clear. I failed to read carefully.**

---

## File Location

**Priority naming:** `Planning/00_READ_TWICE_PROTOCOL.md`

The `00_` prefix ensures this is:
- First in alphabetical order
- First thing I check
- Master protocol above all others

---

**Status:** ACTIVE - Use in every session from now on

**Cross-Reference:**
- Integrates with USER_INTERRUPT_PROTOCOL.md
- Integrates with AUTOSAVE_PROTOCOL_TRACKING.md
- Master protocol for all project communication
