## ❌ FRONTEND ISSUE (Not Infrastructure - Hand to Cursor/Netlify Agent)

### Problem: Duplicate Button IDs
- **Symptom**: Buttons on second page (after login) don't work
- **Root Cause**: Duplicate element IDs break JavaScript event listeners
  - `id="startDiscovery"` appears 2x
  - `id="openUpload"` appears 2x
- **File**: `mosaic_ui/index.html`
- **Owner**: Claude in Cursor (frontend implementation)
- **Fix Required**: Remove duplicate IDs or use event delegation

### Working Elements
- ✅ Login/registration forms work
- ✅ Chat window works
- ❌ Fast Track button (likely works, only 1 instance)
- ❌ Explore/Discovery button (broken - duplicate ID)
- ❌ Upload button (broken - duplicate ID)

---

## FILES CHANGED (Claude Code Session)

### Modified
1. `/requirements.txt` - Added openai, anthropic
2. `/mosaic_ui/netlify.toml` - Added auth proxy routes

### Created
1. `.netlify-deploy-trigger` - Force deployment file
2. `NETLIFY_TROUBLESHOOTING_PROMPT.md` - Troubleshooting guide

### Investigated
1. Git history analysis of netlify.toml location
2. Determined `mosaic_ui/netlify.toml` is active config (not root)

---

## HANDOFF TO NETLIFY AGENT RUNNER

### Your Task
Fix duplicate button IDs in `mosaic_ui/index.html`:

**Problem elements:**
```html
<!-- Duplicate #1 - in welcome section -->
<button id="startDiscovery">explore freely</button>

<!-- Duplicate #2 - in journey flow section -->
<button id="startDiscovery">explore</button>

<!-- Duplicate #1 - in nav -->
<a id="openUpload">upload</a>

<!-- Duplicate #2 - in journey flow -->
<button id="openUpload">upload</button>
```

**Solution options:**
1. Give second instances different IDs (e.g., `startDiscovery2`, `openUpload2`)
2. Use classes instead of IDs and event delegation
3. Remove duplicate buttons if they're redundant

**Test after fix:**
- Visit https://whatismydelta.com
- Sign up or log in
- Try clicking "Explore" and "Upload" buttons
- Verify they work
