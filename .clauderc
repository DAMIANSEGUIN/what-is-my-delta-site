# Claude Code - Mosaic Project Configuration
# Trigger: When user says "Mosaic" in this directory

## Auto-load Context
When the user mentions "Mosaic", automatically:

1. Load Foundation canon from `/Users/damianseguin/Mosaic/foundation/Mosaic_Foundation_v1.0.md`
   - First-order canon for all sessions
   - Environment: Intel MacBook Pro, macOS Monterey, zsh
   - Code rules: No heredocs, no inline comments, clean quoting, one-shot scripts
   - Mosaic umbrella: JSM + WIMD + CoachAI

2. Review current Mosaic project state:
   - Working directory: `/Users/damianseguin/Downloads/WIMD-Railway-Deploy-Project`
   - Read: `CLAUDE_CODE_README.md` (your role and operational rules)
   - Read: `CURSOR_CLAUDE_SYNC_README.md` (current team sync state)
   - Read: `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` (if exists - current architecture)

3. Assume role: **Senior Debugger** per CLAUDE_CODE_README.md
   - Execute tasks directly (no copy-paste commands)
   - Auto-identify project information
   - Document troubleshooting
   - User time is valuable - no syntax errors
