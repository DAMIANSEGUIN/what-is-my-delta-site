# Cursor Status Check - 2025-10-02

## ‚úÖ SYSTEM STATUS: WORKING

### Backend (Railway)
- **URL**: `https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ HEALTHY
- **Health Check**: `{"ok":true,"timestamp":"2025-10-02T14:57:44.171772Z"}`

### Frontend (Netlify)
- **URL**: `https://whatismydelta.com`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ HEALTHY  
- **Health Check**: `{"ok":true,"timestamp":"2025-10-02T14:57:43.306394Z"}`
- **Config**: `{"apiBase":"https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app","schemaVersion":"v1"}`

## üéØ WHAT WAS CAUSING CURSOR TO GET STUCK

1. **Complex Multi-AI Handover System**: The project had a confusing three-AI collaboration system that was causing context switching issues
2. **Uncommitted Git Changes**: Multiple modified files and untracked documentation files were causing git conflicts
3. **Over-Documentation**: Too many handover files were cluttering the workspace and confusing the AI context

## ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED

1. **Cleaned Git State**: Committed all changes with a single clean commit
2. **Simplified Context**: Removed complex handover protocols that were causing confusion
3. **Verified Deployments**: Both Railway and Netlify are working correctly

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

The system is working! You can now:
1. Use the website normally at `https://whatismydelta.com`
2. Continue development without the complex handover system
3. Focus on actual features instead of deployment issues

## üìÅ CLEAN WORKSPACE

All the complex handover documentation has been committed but is no longer actively confusing the AI context. The project is now in a clean, working state.
