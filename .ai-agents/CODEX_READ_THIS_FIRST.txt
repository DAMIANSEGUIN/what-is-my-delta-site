  CODEX: CHAT BROKEN - NEED BROWSER CONSOLE OUTPUT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Claude_Code got stuck fixing chat. Made 2 deployments, still broken.

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. Deploy debug logging:
   ./scripts/deploy.sh netlify

2. Ask user to open browser console and test:
   - Go to https://whatismydelta.com
   - Press F12 (open console)
   - Type in "ask" field, press Enter
   - Copy ALL console output

3. Read full details:
   .ai-agents/FOR_CODEX_CHAT_STILL_BROKEN_2025-11-10.md
   .ai-agents/TEAM_NOTE_CHAT_DEBUG_SESSION_2025-11-10.md

STATUS: User reports "chat window now does not even open"

COMMITS THIS SESSION:
  fe4121d - Fixed sendMsg (deployed - made it worse)
  6d01cf2 - Moved event listeners (deployed - still broken)
  148805e - Added debug logs (NOT DEPLOYED - you do this)

DIAGNOSIS NEEDED: We don't know if:
  - Event listeners attached?
  - Elements found?
  - sendStrip() being called?
  - chatGuard() blocking?

Console output will tell us everything.
