### **CODEX (Systematic Planning Engineer)**
**Priority**: HIGH | **Timeline**: This Week | **Dependencies**: None

#### Task 1: Backend User Authentication APIs
**What**: Implement user registration/login endpoints in FastAPI
**Files to Modify**:
- `api/index.py` - Add user authentication endpoints
- `api/storage.py` - Add user data storage functions
- Database schema - Add users table

**Specific Endpoints Needed**:
```python
POST /auth/register    # User registration
POST /auth/login      # User login
GET  /auth/me         # Get current user
POST /auth/logout     # User logout
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users can register with email/password
- Users can login and receive session token
- User data persists in database
- Frontend authentication connects to backend APIs

#### Task 2: Database Schema Updates
**What**: Add user table and modify existing schema
**Files to Modify**:
- Database schema (SQLite)
- `api/storage.py` - User data functions
- Session management - Link to user accounts

**Schema Changes**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_login TIMESTAMP,
    user_data JSON
);
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User table created with proper indexes
- Password hashing implemented
- User sessions linked to user accounts
- Data migration for existing sessions
