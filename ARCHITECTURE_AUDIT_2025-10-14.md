# Mosaic Platform - Architecture Audit
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Auditor:** Claude Code (Senior SSE)
**Scope:** Production readiness using OWASP + industry standard checklists

## Audit Framework
Based on:
- OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)
- OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)
- Production Readiness Checklists (Auth0, SigNoz, Gruntwork)

---

## 1. AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- [x] User registration with email/password
- [x] Login functionality
- [x] Password minimum length validation (6 chars)
- [x] Email format validation
- [x] User session creation
- [x] Password hashing (SHA-256 with salt) - `api/storage.py:430-433`

### ‚ùå Missing/Broken
- [ ] **Password strength requirements** (no uppercase, numbers, special chars required)
- [ ] **Rate limiting on login attempts** (brute force protection)
- [ ] **Account lockout after failed attempts** (credential stuffing protection)
- [ ] **Password reset email delivery** (placeholder only - `SHARE_WITH_MOSAIC_TEAM.md:119`)
- [ ] **Email verification on registration** (no confirmation email)
- [ ] **Remember me functionality** (session expires on browser close)
- [ ] **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** (not implemented)
- [ ] **Social login options** (Google/GitHub OAuth)
- [ ] **Username field** (only email - no display name)
- [ ] **Password visibility toggle** (no eye icon on password fields)
- [ ] **Logout confirmation dialog** (immediate logout without prompt)
- [ ] **Clear credentials after logout** - JUST FIXED but needs testing

### üîß Issues Found
1. **Weak password hashing**: Using SHA-256 instead of bcrypt/Argon2 (`api/storage.py:432`)
2. **No HTTPS enforcement**: HTTP requests not automatically upgraded
3. **Session reuse bug**: Same user ID gets same session on re-login (database persistence issue)
4. **No logout API call**: Frontend just clears localStorage, backend session persists

---

## 2. SESSION MANAGEMENT

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- [x] Session IDs generated and stored in localStorage
- [x] Session ID passed in headers (`X-Session-ID`)
- [x] Session data stored in SQLite database
- [x] Session cleanup on logout (frontend)

### ‚ùå Missing/Broken
- [ ] **Session expiration/timeout** (sessions never expire)
- [ ] **Session token rotation** (same token used indefinitely)
- [ ] **httpOnly cookies** (using localStorage instead - XSS vulnerable)
- [ ] **Secure flag on cookies** (not using cookies at all)
- [ ] **SameSite attribute** (not using cookies)
- [ ] **Session invalidation on logout** (backend session persists)
- [ ] **Concurrent session limits** (unlimited sessions per user)
- [ ] **Session activity tracking** (no last activity timestamp)
- [ ] **Idle timeout warning** (no warning before session expires)

### üîß Issues Found
1. **localStorage for session tokens** - Vulnerable to XSS attacks (should use httpOnly cookies)
2. **No session TTL** - Sessions live forever in database
3. **Railway database persistence** - SQLite resets on deployment, losing sessions
4. **No backend logout endpoint** - `/auth/logout` doesn't exist
5. **PS101 state persists across logins** - Session reuse causes old state to appear

---

## 3. STATE MANAGEMENT

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- [x] PS101 flow state in session data
- [x] User data stored in localStorage
- [x] Auto-save functionality
- [x] Chat history stored in DOM

### ‚ùå Missing/Broken
- [ ] **State sync between tabs** (localStorage changes don't propagate)
- [ ] **Offline state handling** (app breaks without network)
- [ ] **State versioning** (no migration for schema changes)
- [ ] **State persistence after logout** - JUST FIXED but needs testing
- [ ] **Undo/redo functionality** (no state history)
- [ ] **Draft saving** (lose progress on accidental close despite autosave)
- [ ] **Conflict resolution** (multiple tabs can corrupt state)

### üîß Issues Found
1. **Chat history not cleared on logout** - JUST FIXED
2. **PS101 prompt_index not initialized** - Causes "all questions at once" bug - JUST FIXED
3. **No state cleanup between sessions** - Old PS101 state persists
4. **localStorage has no size limits** - Can fill up browser storage
5. **No state validation** - Corrupted state causes crashes

---

## 4. USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- [x] Trial mode (5 minutes for unauthenticated users)
- [x] Loading states for API calls
- [x] Error messages displayed
- [x] Auto-save indicator
- [x] Chat interface

### ‚ùå Missing/Broken
- [ ] **Loading spinners** (just text "loading...")
- [ ] **Error recovery suggestions** (errors just say "failed")
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts** (no shortcuts for common actions)
- [ ] **Accessibility (ARIA labels)** (minimal ARIA attributes)
- [ ] **Mobile responsive design** (desktop-only layout)
- [ ] **Empty state messaging** (blank screens when no data)
- [ ] **Onboarding tutorial** (no first-time user guide)
- [ ] **Progress indicators** (no "Step 1 of 10" in PS101)
- [ ] **Success confirmations** (actions complete silently)
- [ ] **Form validation feedback** (errors shown after submit, not during typing)
- [ ] **Copy to clipboard buttons** (for sharing resume/responses)
- [ ] **Export/download functionality** (can't export conversation history)

### üîß Issues Found
1. **PS101 shows all questions at once** - JUST FIXED (shows one at a time now)
2. **Generic advice pile** - JUST FIXED (PS101 auto-activates now)
3. **Login fields persist after logout** - JUST FIXED
4. **No back button** (can't go back to previous PS101 question)
5. **No skip option** (forced through all PS101 questions)
6. **Chat doesn't scroll to bottom** (new messages off-screen)
7. **No typing indicator** (can't tell if bot is responding)
8. **No message timestamps** (can't tell when conversation happened)

---

## 5. ERROR HANDLING

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- [x] Try-catch blocks in async functions
- [x] HTTP error status codes
- [x] Error messages returned to frontend

### ‚ùå Missing/Broken
- [ ] **User-friendly error messages** (technical errors shown to users)
- [ ] **Error logging/monitoring** (no Sentry/LogRocket)
- [ ] **Retry logic** (network failures = permanent failure)
- [ ] **Graceful degradation** (app crashes instead of showing fallback)
- [ ] **Error boundaries** (uncaught errors crash entire app)
- [ ] **Offline mode** (no service worker/cache)
- [ ] **Network error handling** (generic "connection issue" message)

---

## 6. SECURITY HEADERS & CONFIGURATION

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- [x] CORS configured (FastAPI middleware)
- [x] JSON validation (Pydantic models)

### ‚ùå Missing/Broken
- [ ] **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)** header
- [ ] **X-Frame-Options** header (clickjacking protection)
- [ ] **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff**
- [ ] **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**
- [ ] **Referrer-Policy**
- [ ] **Permissions-Policy**
- [ ] **XSS protection headers**

- [ ] **Data encryption at rest** (SQLite not encrypted)
- [ ] **Connection pooling** (each request opens new connection)
- [ ] **Database migration testing** (migrations not tested before deploy)
- [ ] **Data retention policy** (sessions/data never deleted)
- [ ] **GDPR compliance** (no data export/deletion for users)

### üîß Issues Found
1. **Railway ephemeral storage** - SQLite resets on deployment (CRITICAL)
2. **No Railway volumes** - Uploaded files lost on restart
3. **No database indexes** - Slow queries as data grows
4. **No foreign key constraints** - Data integrity not enforced properly

---
