# WIMD Project State Documentation - 2025-10-24

**Created**: 2025-10-24 16:00 PST
**Purpose**: Baseline documentation before recovery from broken rebase
**Status**: Repository in broken rebase state - NEEDS RECOVERY

---

## Executive Summary

**What Happened:**
- Netlify Agent Runners successfully implemented draggable windows + booking features
- Features were completed and integrated into `frontend/index.html`
- Repository entered broken rebase state during subsequent operations
- No baseline was documented before changes (the critical error)

**Current State:**
- ✅ Netlify Agent's work IS preserved in working tree (`frontend/index.html`)
- ❌ Repository stuck in interactive rebase with merge conflicts
- ⚠️ 17 documentation files staged for deletion
- ⚠️ 8 spec files have merge conflicts

**Recovery Goal:**
- Preserve all Netlify Agent's completed work
- Get repository to clean, working state
- Document this baseline before any future changes

---

## Git Repository State

### Rebase Status
```
Interactive rebase in progress
Rebasing: branch 'main' onto cc9a2dc
Status: BROKEN (merge conflicts)
```

**Rebase Commands:**
- Last command done (1 of 2): `pick 88bd4ec Add Mosaic UI enhancement specifications`
- Next command (1 remaining): `pick fc4edab REFACTOR: Rename specs to match naming convention`

**Recovery Options Available:**
1. `git rebase --abort` - Return to state before rebase started
2. `git rebase --continue` - Continue after resolving conflicts
3. `git rebase --skip` - Skip current problematic commit

### Branch Information
```
Current: (no branch, rebasing main)
Local branches:
  - main
  - phase-4-cursor-attempt-reference

Remote branches:
  - remotes/origin/main
  - remotes/railway-origin/deploy-clean
  - remotes/railway-origin/main
```

### Recent Commit History
```

## Merge Conflicts (8 Files)

All in `frontend/` directory:

### 1. frontend/NETLIFY_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Status: `added by them` (incoming commit has this file)
- Conflict type: New file added in both branches

### 2. frontend/NETLIFY_AGENT_TASK.md
- Status: `both added` (exists in both branches with differences)
- Conflict type: Content conflict - both branches added this file

### 3-8. frontend/docs/specs/ (6 files)
All marked `added by them`:
- mosaic_appointment_booking_spec.md
- mosaic_booking_iframe_spec.md
- mosaic_discount_code_payment_spec.md
- mosaic_draggable_windows_spec.md
- mosaic_visual_depth_spec.md
- mosaic_window_enhancements_spec.md

**Assessment**: These are the Netlify Agent's specification files - MUST BE PRESERVED

## Netlify Agent's Completed Work - VERIFIED PRESENT

### Implementation Status: ✅ PRESERVED IN WORKING TREE

**File**: `frontend/index.html` (59KB)
**Last Modified**: 2025-10-24 15:55

**Features Implemented by Netlify Agent:**

#### 1. Draggable & Resizable Windows System
- ✅ Custom `DraggableWindow` JavaScript class
- ✅ Vanilla JS implementation (no React dependencies)
- ✅ Drag-and-drop positioning
- ✅ Viewport bounds checking
- ✅ Z-index management (clicked windows come to front)
- ✅ Minimize/restore controls
- ✅ Close functionality
- ✅ CSS-based resizing
- ✅ Mobile responsive (dragging disabled <768px)

**Verification**: Class `DraggableWindow` exists in index.html

#### 2. Google Calendar Booking Integration
- ✅ Direct link to Google Calendar: `https://calendar.app.google/EAnDSz2CcTtH849x6`
- ✅ Integrated into user progress panel
- ✅ Styled booking button
- ✅ Security attributes (noopener noreferrer)

**Verification**: Google Calendar link exists in index.html

### Supporting Files (Spec Documents)
Located in `frontend/docs/specs/`:
1. mosaic_draggable_windows_spec.md (6.9KB)
2. mosaic_appointment_booking_spec.md (3.2KB)
3. mosaic_booking_iframe_spec.md (16.7KB)
4. mosaic_discount_code_payment_spec.md (35.5KB)
5. mosaic_visual_depth_spec.md (14.4KB)
6. mosaic_window_enhancements_spec.md (19.6KB)

**Status**: All exist in working tree but have merge conflicts in git

---

## Untracked Files (Not in Git)

Safe to ignore (development artifacts):
- .DS_Store
- .claude-run/
- .env
- .netlify/
- .netlify_site_id
- .test-venv/
- api/
- last_run.log
- tests/

## Working Tree Assessment

### Critical Files Status

#### ✅ SAFE - Netlify Work Preserved
- `frontend/index.html` - Contains all implemented features
- `frontend/docs/specs/*.md` - All 6 spec files exist
- `frontend/NETLIFY_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Exists
- `frontend/NETLIFY_AGENT_TASK.md` - Exists

#### ⚠️ AT RISK - Staged for Deletion
- `frontend/docs/CURSOR_TEAM_README.md`
- `frontend/docs/MOSAIC_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `frontend/docs/OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md`
- `frontend/docs/STRATEGIC_ACTION_PLAN.md`

**Recommendation**: Before proceeding, verify if these contain unique information not present elsewhere

#### ✅ PRESERVED - Root Level Docs
- `README.md` - Unified architecture doc
- `docs/` directory - Separate from frontend/docs
- `backend/` directory - Railway deployment source

## Recovery Strategy Options

### Option 1: Abort Rebase (SAFEST - RECOMMENDED)
**Command**: `git rebase --abort`

**Effect**:
- Returns to state before rebase started
- All work preserved in working tree
- Repository returns to clean `main` branch
- Can then make intentional commits

**Pros**:
- Safest - no risk of losing work
- Clean slate to reorganize
- Can commit Netlify work properly

**Cons**:
- Need to re-do any intentional reorganization manually

**Next Steps After Abort**:
1. Verify all Netlify work still present
2. Commit current state as baseline
3. Review what deletions/changes were intended
4. Make changes incrementally with commits

### Option 2: Resolve Conflicts & Continue
**Commands**:
```bash
git add frontend/NETLIFY_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
git add frontend/NETLIFY_AGENT_TASK.md
git add frontend/docs/specs/*.md
git rebase --continue
```

**Effect**:
- Accepts all incoming Netlify Agent files
- Continues with rebase
- Completes the reorganization

**Pros**:
- Completes the intended rebase operation
- Keeps reorganized structure

**Cons**:
- More complex
- Risk of additional conflicts
- Harder to verify everything preserved

**Next Steps After Continue**:
1. Verify no work lost
2. Check that deletions were intentional
3. Test that nothing broken

### Option 3: Skip Current Commit
**Command**: `git rebase --skip`

**Effect**:
- Skips the problematic commit
- Continues with remaining rebase operations

**Pros**:
- Bypasses conflict

**Cons**:
- May lose intended changes from skipped commit
- Not recommended unless commit is known to be redundant

## Recommended Recovery Plan

### Phase 1: Safe Abort (RECOMMENDED FIRST STEP)
1. **Abort rebase**: `git rebase --abort`
2. **Verify working tree**: Confirm all Netlify work still present
3. **Create baseline commit**: Commit current state with clear message
4. **Document state**: This file serves as reference

### Phase 2: Review Deletions
1. **Check deleted files**: Review the 17 files staged for deletion
2. **Extract important info**: Save any unique content from:
   - CURSOR_TEAM_README.md
   - MOSAIC_ARCHITECTURE.md
   - OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md
   - STRATEGIC_ACTION_PLAN.md
3. **Decide**: Which deletions are intentional cleanup vs. accidental loss

### Phase 3: Intentional Reorganization
1. **Make incremental commits**: One change at a time
2. **Document each change**: Clear commit messages
3. **Verify after each step**: No work lost
4. **Create this baseline doc FIRST**: Before any future changes

---

## Lessons Learned

### Critical Error
**No baseline documentation before making changes**

This state document should have been created BEFORE:
- Attempting Netlify upgrades
- Starting any rebase operations
- Making structural changes to repository

### Prevention Protocol (From Planning Project)
From `TEAM_ORCHESTRATION_README.md`:

**Before ANY changes:**
1. ✅ Read relevant Planning documents completely
2. ✅ Review role and responsibilities
3. ✅ Verify full context understood
4. ✅ **DOCUMENT BASELINE STATE**
5. ✅ Get user approval for approach

**This document fulfills step 4 - should have been done first**

---

## Next Actions - Awaiting User Decision

**User must decide:**
1. **Abort and start fresh?** (Recommended - safest path)
2. **Resolve conflicts and continue?** (More complex but completes rebase)
3. **Something else?**

**Once decided, follow appropriate recovery plan above.**
