# Urgent Request for NARs

PostgreSQL migration deployed but **connection is failing silently**.

**What I need:** Railway deployment logs showing the PostgreSQL connection error message.

**Instructions:** See `URGENT_FOR_NARS_LOGS_NEEDED.md`

**Specifically:** Copy the line that says `[STORAGE] ‚ùå PostgreSQL connection failed: <error>`

Cannot proceed without the actual error message. The silent fallback is masking the root cause.

**Time required:** 5 minutes to get logs

**Updated documentation:** `DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT_POSTGRESQL_MIGRATION.md` (Current Failure State section updated)
