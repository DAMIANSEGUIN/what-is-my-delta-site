**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION
**Production URL**: https://whatismydelta.com
**Backend API**: https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app

---

## Executive Summary

PS101 guided problem-solving sequence is now fully implemented and operational. Users can click "Fast Track" to begin a 10-step guided journey with intelligent tangent handling and gentle redirection.

**Key Achievement**: System now delivers the intended user experience from `MOSAIC_USER_EXPERIENCE_SOURCE_DOC.md` instead of generic coaching responses.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. PS101 10-Step Guided Sequence (Backend)

**File**: `api/ps101_flow.py` (NEW)

**Features**:
- Complete 10-step problem-solving framework from PS101_Intro_and_Prompts.docx
- Tangent detection using keyword matching per step
- Gentle redirection: "Are you ready to resume with the clarifying questions?"
- Exit confirmation to prevent easy abandonment
- Session state tracking for user responses
- Automatic step advancement

**The 10 Steps**:
1. Problem Identification and Delta Analysis
2. Current Situation Analysis
3. Root Cause Exploration
4. Self-Efficacy Assessment
5. Solution Brainstorming
6. Experimental Design
7. Obstacle Identification
8. Action Planning
9. Reflection and Iteration
10. Building Mastery and Self-Efficacy

### 2. Backend Integration

**File**: `api/index.py` (MODIFIED)

**Changes**:
- New endpoint: `POST /wimd/start-ps101`
- Enhanced `_coach_reply()` function with PS101 flow logic
- Tangent handling:
  - Detects when user goes off-topic
  - Provides CSV prompt response via semantic search
  - Adds gentle redirect message
- Exit handling:
  - First "stop" → confirmation request
  - Confirmed "yes" → exits with message
- Session state management integration

**File**: `api/storage.py` (MODIFIED)

**Changes**:
- `get_session_data(session_id)` - Retrieve PS101 state
- `update_session_data(session_id, data)` - Save PS101 progress

### 3. Frontend Integration

**File**: `mosaic_ui/index.html` (MODIFIED)

**Changes**:
- `startPS101()` async function to call backend endpoint
- Fast Track button now triggers PS101 initialization
- Error handling for initialization failures
- Session tracking for PS101 state

**User Flow**:
```
User clicks "Fast Track"
  ↓
Frontend: POST /wimd/start-ps101
  ↓
Backend: Creates session, returns Step 1 message
  ↓
Frontend: Displays Step 1 questions in chat
  ↓
User responds → POST /wimd with prompt
  ↓
Backend: Checks if on-topic or tangent
  ↓
  ├─ On-topic: Record response, advance to Step 2
  └─ Tangent: CSV response + redirect message
```

### 4. Semantic Search Fix (Critical for Tangents)

**File**: `api/index.py` (MODIFIED)

**Problem**: System was comparing user input against "completion" field, not "prompt" field

**Fix**:
```python
# BEFORE
prompt_text = prompt.get("completion", "")  # Wrong field

# AFTER
prompt_text = prompt.get("prompt", "")  # Correct field
```

**Impact**: Now 607 CSV prompts can be properly matched to user tangents using semantic similarity

**File**: `api/prompt_selector.py` (MODIFIED)

**Problem**: Exact string matching meant 99.9% of user input would never match

**Fix**:
```python
# BEFORE
if prompt_data.get("prompt").lower() == user_input.lower():  # Exact match

# AFTER
best_match = semantic_search(user_input, prompts_data)  # Semantic similarity
```

### 5. Documentation Improvements

**File**: `START_HERE.md` (NEW)

**Purpose**: Session initialization protocol for any AI starting fresh

**Key Sections**:
- Mandatory startup checklist
- Role identification (CODEX, Claude Code, Claude in Cursor)
- Document type classification (SOURCE vs ANALYSIS vs OPERATIONS)
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Quick reference card

**File**: `MOSAIC_USER_EXPERIENCE_SOURCE_DOC.md` (MODIFIED)

**Changes**:
- Added document type header: "GAP ANALYSIS"
- Clarified "Missing" means "not implemented in product", not "doesn't exist"
- Cross-references to PS101 source document location
- Updated implementation status with checkmarks

## Technical Architecture

### PS101 Flow Logic

```python
def _coach_reply(prompt, metrics, session_id):
    # Check if PS101 active
    session_data = get_session_data(session_id)
    if session_data.get("ps101_active"):

        # Check for exit signals
        if user_wants_exit:
            if confirmed:
                exit_ps101_flow(session_data)
                return exit_message
            else:
                return get_exit_confirmation()

        # Check if tangent
        if is_tangent(prompt, current_step):
            # Get CSV response for tangent
            tangent_response = get_prompt_response(prompt, csv_prompts)
            redirect_msg = get_redirect_message(current_step)
            return f"{tangent_response}\n\n{redirect_msg}"

        # User is on-topic
        record_ps101_response(session_data, current_step, prompt)
        advance_ps101_step(session_data)
        update_session_data(session_id, session_data)

        # Return next step
        next_step = get_ps101_step(session_data["ps101_step"])
        return format_step_for_user(next_step)

    # Normal CSV→AI fallback (PS101 not active)
    else:
        return get_prompt_response(prompt, csv_prompts)
```

### Tangent Detection

```python
def is_tangent(user_response, current_step):
    """
    Detects tangent by checking if user's response contains
    any keywords from current step's keyword list.

    If no keywords match → likely a tangent
    """
    step_data = get_ps101_step(current_step)
    keywords = step_data.get("keywords", [])

    response_lower = user_response.lower()
    keyword_match = any(keyword in response_lower for keyword in keywords)

    return not keyword_match  # No match = tangent
```

### Session State Structure

```json
{
  "ps101_active": true,
  "ps101_step": 3,
  "ps101_started_at": "2025-10-10T08:00:00Z",
  "ps101_responses": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "response": "I'm stuck in a job that doesn't align...",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-10T08:05:00Z"
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "response": "I've been here for 3 years...",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-10T08:07:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "ps101_tangent_count": 2
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Example: Compliant User (On-Topic)

**User Action**: Clicks "Fast Track"

**System Response**:
> **Step 1: Problem Identification and Delta Analysis**
>
> • What specific challenge are you currently facing in your personal or professional life?
> • Why is it a problem?
> • Reduce this to a simple problem statement
> ...

**User Response**: "I'm stuck in a job that doesn't align with my values. The delta is between feeling unfulfilled now and wanting meaningful work..."

**System Action**: Records response, advances to Step 2

**System Response**:
> **Step 2: Current Situation Analysis**
>
> • Describe your current situation in detail. What factors are contributing to the problem?
> ...

### Example: Tangent-Prone User

**User Action**: At Step 3 (Root Cause Exploration)

**User Response**: "I'm scared to fail again. What if I'm not good enough?"

**System Detects**: No keywords like "causes", "assumptions", "beliefs" → TANGENT

**System Response**:
> Fear of failure often masks deeper patterns. What if being 'wrong' taught you something instead of proving something? Try naming one small risk this week that feels uncomfortable but meaningful.
>
> Are you ready to resume with the clarifying questions?
>
> Let's return to: What do you believe are the underlying causes of this problem?

**User Response**: "Yes, I think the underlying cause is..."

**System Action**: User back on track, records response, advances

### Example: Exit-Seeking User

**User Action**: After Step 2

**User Response**: "This is too hard, I'm done"

**System Detects**: Exit signal

**System Response**:
> Are you sure you want to stop the guided process?
>
> This problem-solving framework works best when you complete all the steps. Taking the time to work through each question can lead to breakthrough insights.
>
> Type 'yes' to exit, or continue sharing your thoughts to keep going.

**User Response**: "yes"

**System Response**:
> Understood. You can return to the guided process anytime by selecting 'Fast Track'. What would you like to explore next?

## Known Limitations

1. **Tangent detection is keyword-based** - May miss some tangents or false-positive on on-topic responses
   - **Mitigation**: Can tune keyword lists per step based on real user data

2. **No progress visualization** - User doesn't see "Step 3 of 10" in UI
   - **Future**: Add progress bar to frontend

3. **No resume capability** - If user exits and returns, starts from Step 1
   - **Future**: Add "resume PS101" option that checks session state

4. **Redirect message is repetitive** - Same phrasing every time
   - **Future**: Vary the redirect message based on tangent count

---

## Success Metrics (To Monitor)

- **Completion Rate**: % of users who start PS101 and complete all 10 steps
- **Tangent Rate**: Average tangents per user session
- **Redirect Success**: % of users who return on-topic after redirect
- **Exit Rate**: % of users who exit before completion
- **Time per Step**: Average time users spend on each step

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Done)
- ✅ Implement PS101 backend logic
- ✅ Wire frontend Fast Track button
- ✅ Fix semantic search for tangent support
- ✅ Deploy to Railway production
- ✅ Verify all endpoints working

### Short-Term (Recommended)
- 🔲 Monitor real user behavior (completion rates, tangent patterns)
- 🔲 Tune keyword lists based on actual tangent examples
- 🔲 Add progress indicator to UI (Step X of 10)
- 🔲 Implement session resume capability
- 🔲 Vary redirect message phrasing

### Long-Term (Future Enhancements)
- 🔲 Add PS101 analytics dashboard
- 🔲 A/B test redirect messages
- 🔲 Machine learning for better tangent detection
- 🔲 Export PS101 responses as PDF for user
- 🔲 Coach can reference PS101 responses in later conversations

## For CODEX Review

**Implementation Type**: Feature Addition (PS101 guided sequence)

**Architecture Changes**:
- New module: `api/ps101_flow.py`
- Extended `_coach_reply()` logic with PS101 flow handling
- New session state fields in SQLite `sessions.user_data`
- New REST endpoint: `POST /wimd/start-ps101`

**Testing Required**:
- ✅ Endpoint connectivity (verified working)
- 🔲 Persona testing (Compliant, Tangent-Prone, Exit-Seeking, Rapid)
- 🔲 Load testing (concurrent PS101 sessions)
- 🔲 Edge cases (session expiry during PS101, corrupt state)

**Documentation Status**:
- ✅ Implementation documented
- ✅ START_HERE.md for future sessions
- ✅ Gap analysis updated
- 🔲 User-facing help text (how to use PS101)

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Low Risk**: PS101 is optional (only activates on Fast Track click)
- **Low Risk**: Doesn't affect existing chat/discovery flows
- **Medium Risk**: Tangent detection may need tuning based on real data
- **Low Risk**: Rollback: Remove endpoint, redirect Fast Track to old message
