# Claude Code Debugging Report - CSV Prompt System Failure
**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Issue**: Production error "No response available - CSV prompts not found and AI fallback disabled or failed"
**Status**: ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - RECOVERY ENDPOINT AVAILABLE
**For**: CODEX Review

---

## Issue Summary

User reported error when testing https://whatismydelta.com:
```
"No response available - CSV prompts not found and AI fallback disabled or failed"
```

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **AI Client Initialization Disabled** ✅ FIXED
**File**: `api/ai_clients.py:12-13, 36-38`

**Problem**: AI client imports were commented out, hardcoding clients to `None`:
```python
# import openai
# from anthropic import Anthropic
...
self.openai_client = None
self.anthropic_client = None
```

**Why**: Unknown - packages are in `requirements.txt` but imports were disabled

**Fix Applied**:
- Uncommented imports with try/except fallback
- Added proper client initialization when API keys present
- Added logging to show initialization status

**Commit**: `ee6712f` - "Fix AI client initialization - uncomment imports"

---

### 2. **Feature Flag Mismatch** ⚠️ REQUIRES RECOVERY ACTION
**Files**: `feature_flags.json` vs `data/mosaic.db` (feature_flags table)

**Problem**: TWO sources of feature flags with different values:

| Source | Location | AI_FALLBACK_ENABLED | Used By |
|--------|----------|---------------------|---------|
| JSON File | `feature_flags.json` | ✅ `true` (after fix) | `settings.py` only |
| Database | `data/mosaic.db` table | ❌ `0` (false) | prompt_selector, experiment_engine, rag_engine |

**Code Evidence**:
```python
# settings.py - reads JSON file
def get_feature_flag(flag_name: str) -> bool:
    flags_path = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent / "feature_flags.json"

# prompt_selector.py - reads DATABASE
def _check_feature_flag(self, flag_name: str) -> bool:
    row = conn.execute(
        "SELECT enabled FROM feature_flags WHERE flag_name = ?",
        (flag_name,)
    ).fetchone()
```

**Impact**:
- Modified `feature_flags.json` to `enabled: true`
- But prompt system reads from DATABASE which still has `0`
- Health check fails because database value = false

**Commit**: `ebb12f4` - "Enable AI fallback for prompt system" (JSON only, DB not updated)

---

### 3. **Wrong Git Remote Used** ✅ CORRECTED
**Problem**: Pushed fixes to wrong repository

**Git Remotes**:
- `origin`: `wimd-railway-deploy.git` (development repo) ❌ Wrong
- `railway-origin`: `what-is-my-delta-site.git` (Railway deployment repo) ✅ Correct

**What Happened**:
1. Made fixes and pushed to `origin` (commits ebb12f4, ee6712f)
2. Railway deploys from `railway-origin` - didn't receive changes
3. Production continued serving old code

**Documentation Evidence**:
- `CODEX_HANDOFF_2025-10-01.md:15` - "Pushed to wrong repositories (wimd-railway-deploy instead of what-is-my-delta-site)"
- This was a KNOWN ISSUE, documented but repeated

**Fix Applied**: Pushed to `railway-origin` correctly

---

### 4. **Health Check Failure** ⚠️ BLOCKING DEPLOYMENT
**File**: `api/index.py:420-471`

**Problem**: `/health` endpoint returns 503, causing Railway deployment to fail

**Health Check Logic**:
```python
@app.get("/health")
def health():
    prompt_health = get_prompt_health()
    fallback_enabled = prompt_health.get("fallback_enabled", False)  # Reads DB = 0
    ai_available = prompt_health.get("ai_health", {}).get("any_available", False)

    prompt_system_ok = fallback_enabled or ai_available  # Both false
    overall_ok = prompt_system_ok and db_ok  # False

    if not overall_ok:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail=health_status)  # 503 = deployment fails
```

**Railway Deployment Logs**:
```
✅ OpenAI client initialized
✅ Anthropic client initialized
INFO: Application startup complete.
INFO: "GET /health HTTP/1.1" 503 Service Unavailable  ← Blocks deployment
```

**Why Health Check Fails**:
1. AI clients initialize successfully (logs confirm)
2. But database has `AI_FALLBACK_ENABLED = 0`
3. Health check sees fallback disabled → returns 503
4. Railway sees 503 → marks deployment as failed
5. Old deployment stays active

---

## CSV Prompt System Status

### Files Verified ✅
- `data/prompts.csv` - 607 prompts (135KB)
- `data/prompts_f19c806ca62c.json` - 607 prompts converted (159KB)
- `data/prompts_registry.json` - Points to correct active file

**Test**:
```bash
python3 -c "import json; data = json.load(open('data/prompts_f19c806ca62c.json')); print(f'Loaded {len(data)} prompts')"
# Output: Loaded 607 prompts
```

**Conclusion**: CSV prompts ARE available and loading correctly locally. Issue is NOT with CSV files.

## Current Production State

**Deployment**: ❌ FAILED (health check 503)
**Application**: ✅ RUNNING (but not serving traffic)
**AI Clients**: ✅ INITIALIZED
**API Keys**: ✅ CONFIGURED
**Database Flag**: ❌ `AI_FALLBACK_ENABLED = 0` (needs update)

**Runtime Logs**:
```
✅ OpenAI client initialized
✅ Anthropic client initialized
INFO: Application startup complete.
INFO: "GET /health HTTP/1.1" 503 Service Unavailable
```

---

## Recovery Solution

### Option 1: Use Built-in Recovery Endpoint ✅ RECOMMENDED

**Action**: Call the auto-recovery endpoint:
```
POST https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app/health/recover
```

**What It Does** (`api/monitoring.py:108-143`):
1. Clears prompt selector cache
2. Updates database: `UPDATE feature_flags SET enabled = 1 WHERE flag_name = 'AI_FALLBACK_ENABLED'`
3. Re-tests system
4. Returns recovery status

**Expected Result**:
- Database flag updated to `1`
- Health check passes
- Railway deployment succeeds
- Production resumes serving traffic

---

### Option 2: Manual Database Update

**SQL**:
```sql
UPDATE feature_flags
SET enabled = 1
WHERE flag_name = 'AI_FALLBACK_ENABLED';
```

**Access**: Would require Railway database connection or migration

---

### Option 3: Remove Health Check from Deployment ⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED

**Change**: Modify health endpoint to always return 200
**Risk**: Loses auto-restart capability for broken deployments

---

## Fixes Applied

### Commit: `ee6712f` - AI Client Initialization
**File**: `api/ai_clients.py`
**Changes**:
- Uncommented `import openai` and `from anthropic import Anthropic`

```

### Problem
- JSON file is version-controlled and deployed
- Database is runtime state, persists across deployments
- Changes to JSON don't automatically sync to database
- Most code reads database, not JSON
- Creates confusion and deployment failures

### Recommendation for CODEX
**Decision Required**: Choose one source of truth

**Option A**: Database as Source of Truth
- Remove `feature_flags.json`
- Create migration to initialize database from defaults
- Use admin endpoint to change flags
- Pros: Runtime updates, no deployments needed
- Cons: Flags not in version control

**Option B**: JSON as Source of Truth
- Modify all `_check_feature_flag()` methods to use `get_feature_flag()` from settings.py
- Remove database feature_flags table
- Pros: Version controlled, deployment sets flags
- Cons: Requires deployment to change flags

**Option C**: Sync on Startup
- Add startup code to sync JSON → Database
- Database becomes cache of JSON
- Pros: Version controlled + runtime queries
- Cons: Startup complexity, sync conflicts

## Files Changed

```
api/ai_clients.py                    # Fixed AI client initialization
feature_flags.json                   # Enabled AI_FALLBACK (JSON only)
```

**Pushed to**: `railway-origin/main` (commits: ebb12f4, ee6712f)

## Testing Checklist

Once recovery endpoint is called:

- [ ] `/health` returns 200 instead of 503
- [ ] `/health/prompts` shows `"fallback_enabled": 1`
- [ ] `/health/prompts` shows `"openai": {"available": true}`
- [ ] `/health/prompts` shows `"anthropic": {"available": true}`
- [ ] Railway deployment succeeds (health check passes)
- [ ] User can test https://whatismydelta.com without CSV error
- [ ] Prompt responses work (either CSV or AI fallback)

## Lessons Learned

### Protocol Violations by Claude Code
1. ❌ **Pushed to wrong git remote** (documented known issue, repeated anyway)
2. ❌ **Modified code without understanding full architecture** (didn't realize dual flag sources)
3. ✅ **Correctly identified as debugging task** (no CODEX planning required)
4. ✅ **Followed human direction** (made fixes, pushed when instructed)

### System Design Issues
1. **Dual feature flag sources** causing sync issues
2. **Health check too strict** - blocks deployments when recoverable
3. **AI client imports commented out** - unclear why this was done
4. **Auto-deploy webhook** may not be configured for `railway-origin` repo

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Human Action Required)
1. **Call recovery endpoint**: `POST /health/recover`
2. **Verify deployment succeeds** in Railway dashboard
3. **Test production site** - confirm prompt system works

### Short-term (CODEX Planning)
1. **Decide feature flag architecture** (Option A/B/C above)
2. **Document deployment process** (which remote to push to)
3. **Add deployment verification script** (automated testing)

### Medium-term (System Improvements)
1. **Add integration tests** for prompt system
2. **Monitoring alerts** for 503 health checks
3. **Deployment pipeline** with staging environment
4. **Auto-sync feature flags** or consolidate to single source

---

## Questions for CODEX

1. **Feature Flags**: Which option (A/B/C) for single source of truth?
2. **Health Check**: Should it return 503 and block deployments, or just log warnings?
3. **AI Clients**: Why were the imports commented out originally?
4. **Git Workflow**: Should there be pre-push hooks to prevent wrong remote?
5. **Database Migrations**: Should feature flag changes be in migrations?

---

## Supporting Evidence

### Git Remote Configuration
```bash
$ git remote -v
origin          https://github.com/DAMIANSEGUIN/wimd-railway-deploy.git
railway-origin  https://github.com/DAMIANSEGUIN/what-is-my-delta-site.git
```

### Railway Build Success
```
=== Successfully Built! ===
Build time: 400.90 seconds
```

### Railway Health Check Failure
```
Attempt #1 failed with service unavailable. Continuing to retry for 4m52s
[... 14 attempts total ...]
```

### Production Runtime Logs
```
✅ OpenAI client initialized
✅ Anthropic client initialized
INFO: Application startup complete.
INFO: "GET /health HTTP/1.1" 503 Service Unavailable
```

### Current Production Status
```
/health → 503 (deployment blocked)
/health/prompts → {"fallback_enabled": 0, "openai": {"available": false}}
```
